# Emotion-Classification
I have implemented the PCA and LDA from scratch to see the inner workings of the model.
First i have applied PCA to reduce the dimension of the images and since it is two class data, i have applied LDA and projected the data onto 1 dimensional
space then used a threshold to classify images. It gave 90% accuracy
